    <h1>JSP 2.0 Expression Language - Basic Arithmetic</h1>
    <hr>
    This example illustrates basic Expression Language arithmetic.
    Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/ or div),
    and modulus (% or mod) are all supported.  Error conditions, like
    division by zero, are handled gracefully.
